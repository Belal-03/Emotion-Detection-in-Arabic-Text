## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives & Tasks

### Part 1: Data Preprocessing
- Load and explore the dataset  
- Clean the Arabic text by removing:  
  - Punctuation  
  - Diacritics  
  - Stop words  
- Tokenize the Arabic text  
- Normalize words to handle variants  

### Part 2: Text Representation Techniques
Implement and compare the following vectorization methods:  
- **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**  
- **TF-IDF**  
- **Word2Vec** (preferably pre-trained models like AraVec or fastText)  

### Part 3: Classical Machine Learning Models
Using BoW, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec representations, train and evaluate:  
1. Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)  
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF kernel  
3. Decision Tree (DT)  
4. Random Forest (RF)  
5. AdaBoost  

### Part 4: Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN)
- Inputs: TF-IDF and averaged Word2Vec vectors  
- Architecture: Dense layers with ReLU activation and Softmax output  

### Part 5: Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)
- Inputs: Pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings and tokenized, padded sequences  
- Model: LSTM layers (optional: BiLSTM for improved performance)  
- Output: Softmax layer for emotion classification
